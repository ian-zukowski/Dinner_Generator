* (2) Create a user-input model for selecting 5 recipes
    * Add a filter to manually select
    * Add a random select button if not wanting to choose

    ## CODE
    - Use MsgBox to allow user to input a specific recipe id
    - Dim empty variables for each item that needs to be grabbed
    - Randomly choose a recipe_id
    - Save the values of that recipe_id and print in the destination worksheet


'Define the sub-routine to run
	'Get input on how many recipes user wants for the week

	'Activate the worksheet which contains the data
	'Dim RowCount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row to find total amount of rows


	'Dim column variables as strings/integers
	'string are: name, type, meat, bread, nood, rice, beans, cheese, potato, spotato, sauce, extra, recipe
	'integer are: avocado, bpep, broc, bsquash, carrot, celery, corn, cuc, gbeans, gpep, onion, tomato, spinach, ysquash, zucc
	'boolean are: jalapeno, ketchup, mustard, crackers, sourc, salad

	
	'Create X iterations for recipeIndex for loop
		'Dim A as random value from 2 to RowCount (this may make duplicates in the weekly recipes -- these can be replaced by separate subfunction)
		'Use (2 to RowCount) so it doesn't try to use title row
